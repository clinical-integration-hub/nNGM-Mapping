# Therapie CTS Transport -> FHIR Test

## Configuration:

# CDS -> FHIR:
* Vonk version: Vonk FHIR server 3.9.3
* Using Test Data/Antrag-CDS-Export.json and Test Data/2. Patient-FHIR-Bundle-2-Antrag.json

* Known issues: 
    * Patient (Todesdatum) was decidedly not mapped 
    * Operation -> Resectionsstatus/Art der resection  not mapping: should be inside same extension[] scope as resectionsart, currently not possible due to collate bug

* Result: 
    * 1 error: slice by profile error by simplifier validator
    * 2 warnings: related to not  finding loinc valuesets

# FHIR -> CDS:
* Vonk version: Vonk FHIR server 3.9.3
* Using Test Data/3. Antrag-CDS-Export-Transformed.json and Test Data/2. Patient-FHIR-Bundle-2-Antrag.json

* Known Issues:
    * Systemische Therapie output is present 4 times
    * Strahlentherapie output is present 2 times
    * Todesdatum (Patient) is missing from each form by decision 
    * Operation -> ResectionStatus/Art der resection would map but is not present in generated FHIR bundles (see cds -> FHIR known issues)
    * Strahlentherapie -> Ende der Bestrahlung doesnâ€™t support multiple choices in mapping, but form does for some reason. In reverse map only 1 value can be selected 

* Result: 
    *
